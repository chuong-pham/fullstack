      My name is Chuong Pham, and I am a service member. I had been serving in
      the U.S Army for 2 years before considering the transition from active
      duty. My major is Computer Science. I also completed my
      Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at Vietnam National
      University in 2015 and then my family moved to the United States. I
      enrolled in Skillstorm's Java Full Stack Bootcamp as a new starting point
      for my new journey in my life.
